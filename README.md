# Fitness Class Booking API


This is a simple FastAPI backend I built for managing bookings in a fictional fitness studio. It handles Yoga, Zumba, and HIIT sessions ‚Äî just like a real booking system, but with in-memory data and no external database.

---

## üîç What It Does

- üìÖ **See upcoming classes** ‚Äì Only shows future sessions so you don't accidentally book the past!
- ‚úÖ **Book your spot** ‚Äì Prevents duplicate bookings and checks for availability before confirming.
- üìß **Check bookings by email** ‚Äì Search what you've booked using just your email.
- üïí **Timezone-aware** ‚Äì Everything runs in IST (Indian Standard Time) using `pytz`.
- üß† **No DB hassle** ‚Äì All data is stored in-memory for easy testing and demo.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Built-in validation** ‚Äì Thanks to Pydantic + FastAPI.
- üß™ **Includes tests** ‚Äì I wrote some unit tests to make sure the main logic works correctly.
